  Statsig's normal (remote evaluation) SDKs are recommended for most client applications. Understand the use case and privacy risks by reading the [On-Device Eval SDK overview](/client/onDevice). On-device evaluation SDKs are for Enterprise & Pro Tier only.

The `{sdkName}` SDK uses a different paradigm than its precomputed counterpart ([{otherSDKName}]({otherSDKLink})). 
It is a Client SDK that behaves more like a Server SDK. Rather than requiring a user up front, you can check gates/configs/experiments for any set of user properties, because the SDK downloads a complete representation of your project and evaluates checks in real time.

### Pros
- No need for a network request when changing user properties - just check the gate/config/experiment locally
- Can bring your own CDN or synchronously initialize with a preloaded project definition
- Lower latency to download configs cached at the edge, rather than evaluated for a given user (which cannot be cached as much)

### Cons
- Entire project definition is available client side - the names and configurations of all experiments and feature flags accessible by your client key are exposed. See our [client key with server permission best practices](/sdk-keys/api-keys/#client-keys-with-server-permissions)
- Payload size is strictly larger than what is required for the [{otherSDKName}]({otherSDKLink})
- Evaluation performance is slightly slower - rather than looking up the value, the SDK must actually evaluate targeting conditions and an allocation decision
- Does not support ID list segments with > 1000 IDs
- Does not support IP or User Agent based checks (Browser Version/Name, OS Version/Name, IP, Country)
